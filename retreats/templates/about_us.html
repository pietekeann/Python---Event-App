                <p>At Aloha, the whole community was born through something of divine providence, a calling from the
                    Universe, an ability to read the signs and a willingness to respond to them. We believe that there
                    are no coincidences, that realising this dream is what we are destined to do here on this earth.

                <h1 class="display-5 mb-5">Jason</h1>
                <p>Jason came to Colombia as a traveler, hailing from Canada. He found himself searching for a deeper
                    meaning to life, for a way to dedicate himself to something which had true significance. Through his
                    communion with entheogenic plants he also realised that living in close harmony with the land was
                    calling him, and when he arrived at Aloha he knew that he could achieve this dream.</p>

                <h1 class="display-5 mb-5">Max</h1>
                <p>Max, originally from England, arrived in Colombia with the hopes of creating a school of
                    permaculture, and with dreams of building a bridge between modern concepts and technology and the
                    ancestral wisdom and heart opening plants of the indigenous tribes of South America. He is committed
                    to empowering people to grow their own food, to build their own dwellings, and to nurture individual
                    freedom through voluntary cooperative action.</p>

                <h1 class="display-5 mb-5">Rike</h1>
                <p>Rike came as a response to the call for more feminine energy on the farm. Aloha immediately felt like
                    home to her when she first arrived in December 2016 and it has been since. Apart from her passions:
                    yoga, exploring nature and walking barefoot, she has grown in the community holding womenÂ´s circles,
                    giving Yoga classes and cooking delicious vegan food. The healing power of community, nature and the
                    Sacred Medicines have allowed her to live a dream she had never imagined living when she started her
                    travels in Colombia.
